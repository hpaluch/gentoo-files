# Gentoo Files

Here are my Gentoo configuration files that I use on my machines.

I have two computers
1. is AMD Opteron (2 cores)
2. is Intel Celeron (4 cores)

When available I use build server for Gentoo binary packages and installing them
on later on target (which is not so much powerful).

I have to make intersection of available CPU features on build server and target computer.

Here are coresponding folders:
* [amd/](amd/)
